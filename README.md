# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Overview

This repository is my attempt at solving data structures and algorithms problems daily. The problems that I choose to answer come from various sources from the internet. I will be adding them in the readme as I go along. 


## Language

The main laguage I will be using is python because this is what I am most comfortable in using, however I am open to adding more solutions with different languages if time allows it.


## Structure

Each directory I have a is a new problem that I am trying to solve. I will add a readme for every directory describing the problem, and a link to the way I got to my solution. 

My personal solution will be named with **problemname - personal**, while the online solution will be labelled as **problemname - online**.
